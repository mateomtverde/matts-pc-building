![[pexels-waterhouse-3665442.jpg]]

Choosing the correct motherboard that supports the selected CPU is important in the PC planning process. When selecting the motherboard for the build and the intended use of the PC, the PC builder needs to check the manufacturer's list of supported CPU's. The first step of selecting a motherboard is to pair it with a CPU that has the correct type of socket and then determine if the motherboard supports the CPU. See the [[cpu selection]] selection section for more information.
