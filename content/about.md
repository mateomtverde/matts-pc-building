My name is Matthew Green. I have been building computers since 2016. I have researched compatibility with multiple combinations of hardware, and kept up with the latest technology during my time building computers. I learned to build computers on my own by watching videos, reading articles, or just learning by failed attempts. I would love to assist you with your personal computer needs.
