## Air Cooling

Air cooling is a great way to cool off your CPU to keep it operating at max performance and increasing the CPU's lifespan. It is cheaper than liquid cooling, which can be a more budget friendly way to plan a PC build. 

## Liquid Cooling

Liquid cooling is a great option, especially with CPU's that typically run hot. The PC builder will need to research a particular CPU to see the normal operating temperatures to determine the  cooling needs.

## Summary

Air cooling and liquid cooling are both good options for cooling the CPU. It takes research before selecting the proper cooling method the PC builder will use. If a CPU will be performing intensive tasks and runs at a high frequency, then liquid cooling will likely be needed.
