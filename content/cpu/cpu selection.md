## Core Count

Part of the selection process when planning to build a computer is to select a CPU with the proper core count for the intended use. For instance, if the PC builder is going to be utilizing CPU intensive tasks then the selection would be a CPU with a higher core count. If the task is gaming then the selection wouldn't be based as much on the cores, it would be based more on the speed of the cores. 

The PC builder also needs to make sure the CPU does not bottleneck the GPU, especially when gaming. A proper CPU will ensure the GPU operates at it's full potential. Max performance of the GPU, especially when playing games competitively, is a must.

## Single Thread vs Multi Thread

Depending on the intended use of the PC the builder may be able to save money by purchasing a single thread cpu. This is a good choice for beginners, especially those who want to build a gaming pc for games that do not need a multithread cpu. The downside of selecting this cpu would be the lack of multitasking. 

If the PC builder needs to run extensive tasks, such as video editing, they should look into selecting a CPU with multithread capabilities. However, in today's world CPU manufacturers, such as _Intel_ offer the ability to have performance cores that are single-threaded and efficiency cores for multithreaded workloads.

## Integrated Graphics

Integrated graphics can save the PC builder money and space. This option is great if it can handle the graphical processing power needed for the intended use. See the [[gpu selection]] for more information.
