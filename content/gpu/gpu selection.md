# Types of GPU's

* Integrated
* Discrete

## Integrated GPU's

Integrated GPU's can be a great option for the PC builder that is building a PC just to surf the web and do light editing. This option is great for those on a budget since discrete GPU's can be the most expensive part of the build. This is also a great option for those that intend to save space. An integrated GPU within the CPU will allow the PC builder to purchase a smaller motherboard and in return a smaller computer tower(case). See [[cpu selection]] for more information.

## Discrete GPU's 

Discrete GPU's are required for the PC builder whose intended use is for intensive gaming or editing. This normally means that you will need to select a larger tower(case) to house the graphics card. This is due to cooling needed for the card and the dimensions of the card, as well as a motherboard with a slot for the GPU. Check out the motherboard [[gpu compatibility]] section for more information.
