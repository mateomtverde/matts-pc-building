* Liquid Cooling
## Air Cooling

Most GPU's are equipped with air cooling from the factory. However, if the PC builder is going to overclock the GPU or run GPU intensive tasks, they may want to look into upgrading to liquid cooling. This determination will be based on the [[size selection]] of the computer tower(case). Upgrading to liquid cooling for a GPU can take up a lot of room inside the case. 

## Liquid Cooling

Some GPU's come with a closed loop liquid cooling system that includes a radiator and fans. These GPU's are high-end and can be expensive. The PC builder will need to research the type of GPU they need for the build's intended use and determine if it is cheaper to purchase a GPU with stock fans and convert it to liquid cooling, or purchase a GPU that includes liquid cooling from factory.
