# Storage Selection

For storage selection we must consider the intended use of the PC and the [[storage capability]] of the computer tower(case). The storage type is based on several factors. The PC builder will need to balance cost versus speed. Typical HDD's offer tons of storage with a typically lower cost, compared to SSD's and M.2's. However, boot times for your system with be slower.

SSD's offer a step up in performance and can still be purchased for a good price. The only downside is the SSD, being as small as it is, still requires bulky cables. Depending on the market, my personal recommendation for overall performance and fast boot times is the M.2. It provides top of the line speed and can be purchased online for a really good price nowadays. 

Consider this for storage selection:

* HDD - storing photos and videos
* SSD - budget gaming and boot drive
* M.2 - high-end gaming and fastest boot times
