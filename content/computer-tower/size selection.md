# Computer Tower Sizes

* Small Form Factor
* Mini Tower
* Mid Tower
* Full Tower

## Small Form Factor

The small form factor tower(case) is a suitable solution for those looking to save space. However, if the intended use is for graphical processing power such as gaming, this may not be a good solution depending on the games that will be played. The [[cooling requirements]] for the internal hardware may also be a problem.

> **Your SFF case may not support all GPUs.** While many SFF cases support full-size GPUs, that doesn’t mean universal support. Large, multislot GPUs might not be compatible with your case, so you’ll still need to carefully consider the height and width of your GPU and plan accordingly.

## Mini Tower

Mini towers can offer a step up and still save space. It can a little more cooling and give the option to step up into a mid-level gaming setup. 

## Mid Tower

Mid towers offer the best option for a budget, [[cooling requirements]], performance, and upgradability. This option can fit in different air cooling and liquid cooling options depending on the layout of the tower(case). This is a really good option for most PC builders.

## Full Tower

The full tower offers endless options for the PC builder. Multiple [[cooling requirements]], [[size selection]], and [[motherboard compatibility]] are achieved when selecting the full tower to build a PC. This option is normally something a builder would not choose if on a budget. 

## Summary

Multiple options are out there as far as PC towers are concerned. My personal recommendation is the mid tower. It offers they ability to configure different cooling solutions, motherboards, and storage options to acquire performance results for the intended use.
