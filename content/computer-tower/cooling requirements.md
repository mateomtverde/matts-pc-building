## Air Cooling

Air cooling is a popular pick among PC builders. It is cheaper than liquid cooling in most cases and is hassle-free when it comes to maintenance. Many consider it the most reliable and budget friendly way to cool PC components.
	
> Air cooling systems are easier to install than liquid cooling and are therefore the better choice for beginner PC builders. You also wonâ€™t need to worry about water potentially leaking into your system!

## Liquid Cooling

Liquid cooling is another option, especially for more experienced PC builders. However, it is usually more expensive and requires and little bit of knowledge and research as far as assembly is concerned. This option requires periodic maintenance as well due to possible leaks and permiation. If assembly is not performed correctly leaks and occur and damage PC components resulting in added replacement cost and time.


## Summary

Choosing a computer tower(case) can be challenging. The [[size selection]] is based on the cooling requirements, [[motherboard compatibility]], [[storage capability]], and for some PC builders, especially beginners, making sure they select [[user friendly towers]]. Some products run at a higher temperature than others and research will have to be done to determine the temperatures the specific build will operate at. Whether it is air cooling or liquid cooling, or a combination of both, the system needs each component to stay within an operating temperature range in order to provide the best operation and to ensure the longevity of the components.
