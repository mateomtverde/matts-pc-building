## HDD

Hard Disk Drives(HDD) offer a budget friendly storage option for the PC builder. However, the PC builder should consider the [[size selection]] of the computer tower in order to house the HDD since it is much larger than a SSD or M.2. 

## SSD

Solid State Drives are another good storage option. They provide a lot of storage for a decent price for the PC builder. They can be place almost anywhere inside the computer tower. They provide fast read/write speeds for fast load and boot times.

## M.2

M.2 storage drives are have among the fastest read/write speeds available. If you are into high-level gaming and want the fastest load times this option is really good. They are more expensive than the other options, but if the PC builder can find a good deal online they are definitely worth it.

## Summary

There are multiple storage options available. I recommend the M.2 since most motherboards have a slot for it and there is no need for excess cable management.
