# Sizes of Motherboards

* Mini-ITX
* Micro-ATX
* ATX
* E-ATX
## Mini-ITX

Mini-ITX is a good option for those choosing to build their PC in a small form factor tower. The PC builders will have to consider [[cooling requirements]] and [[storage capability]] for the intended use of the PC before selecting this option. Mini-ITX is limited when it comes to graphical performance, due to it utilizing the integrated graphics within the CPU(APU).

## Micro-ATX

Micro-ATX is a good step up and can keep PC builders on a budget, while offering a GPU slot for upgraded graphics if needed. PC builders will need to refer to [[size selection]] of the tower(case) since some small form factors do not support this motherboard.

> Each component is specifically designed to fit a certain size and design specifications in the hardware world. This is especially true in computers, where internal hardware like motherboards, storage drives, and memory modules vary widely in shape and size. This variation is referred to as the 'form factor.' Essentially, the form factor is a term for the design blueprint of hardware components, dictating their shape, size, and other physical characteristics, ensuring that they fit and function seamlessly in a computer system.

## ATX

ATX motherboards offer more options and it is my recommendation for most PC builders. It offers multiple options for GPU, CPU, and [[storage capability]]. This option supports multiple intended uses.

## E-ATX

Extended ATX motherboards can handle pretty much anything a PC builder can throw at it. However, I wouldn't recommend this for entry-level PC builders or those who are on a budget. The tower options for this motherboard would not be budget friendly for the most part and for the average gamer or PC user it is unnecessary. This option would be more for PC enthusiasts willing to pay the price.

## Summary

Multiple motherboard options are out there. I personally recommend the ATX motherboard. It offers more options than the smaller motherboards and the PC builder can find a suitable case while on a budget.
