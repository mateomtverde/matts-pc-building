## Cable Management

When building a PC cable management can become a hassle. The PC builder needs to keep this in mind when determining the [[size selection]] of their tower. If choosing to have a smaller case for the PC build the cable management can become a headache trying to fit more components than what the tower(case) was designed for.

> There’s no doubt about it: Taking the time to tidy up your cables is something every system builder and upgrader should do.
> Aside from the small additional effort it takes, there are no downsides whatsoever—but benefits abound. Even if you’re not into the clean aesthetic, a PC with its cables properly routed and secured will run cooler and quieter, accumulate dust more slowly, and be easier to upgrade in the future.
