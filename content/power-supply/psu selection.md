# Selecting the PSU

When selecting a PSU the PC builder will need to add up all of the components power requirements in watts. **_PCPartsPicker.com_** provides estimated wattage by inputing the components in the list. Check out the website [here](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ It is also important to select the correct form factor for your selected tower(case). 

It's important that the PSU provides good efficiency and provides the proper cables to power the components. I like to purchase power supply's that provide approximately 200 watts over the requirement in case I am looking to upgrade in the future. I prefer 80 plus gold PSU's or higher for efficiency if building a high-end gaming PC.
