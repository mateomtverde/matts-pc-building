# Ram Selection

To determine the correct RAM for your PC build. You first need to determine the [[ram compatibility]] with the motherboard. Once this is determined the PC builder needs to select the amount of RAM based on the intended use of the PC. 

There are other things to consider here, like making sure the the form factor is correct and the CPU cooler clearance will not be an issue. The PC builder will also need to consider speed and timing of the RAM for its intended use. For this, the PC builder will need to check the motherboard's maximum supported speed and choose a kit that will match it or exceed it, and also check the supported timings.

Consider this when determining how much RAM is needed:

* Light workloads (browsing the web) - 4 to 8 GB
* Moderate workloads (streaming) - 16 GB
* Heavy workloads (gaming) - 32 GB or more
